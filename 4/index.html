            <!-- overview: Briefly stated overall purpose/ outline of the project -->
            <p>
                In this project, we continue (recall <a href="../3/">last project</a>) exploring physics-based simulations by implementing a cloth simulation. Additionally, we introduce shaders to the scene to give the cloth a more realistic appearance.

            <div>
                <h1>Masses and springs</h1>
                <p>
                    We begin by constructing a cloth as a grid of point masses connected by springs. You can see shearing springs connect diagonally adjacent nodes; however, you cannot see the difference between structural and bending springs -- the former join horizontally and vertically adjacent nodes, while the latter join in same directions but two nodes apart. Moreover, we weaken the bending springs to 20% of the base spring strength.
                </p>
                <!-- Take some screenshots of scene/pinned2.json from a viewing angle where you can clearly see the cloth wireframe to show the structure of your point masses and springs. -->
                <!-- Show us what the wireframe looks like (1) without any shearing constraints, (2) with only shearing constraints, and (3) with all constraints. -->

                <p>
                    To model the cloth's behavior, we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration">Verlet integration</a> to update the position as $$x_{t+1} = x_t + (1-d) \cdot (x_t - x_{t-1}) + \frac{f}{m} \cdot \Delta t^2$$ where $d$ is the damping factor, $f$ is the force, $m$ is the mass, and $\Delta t$ is the time step. The force is recalculated at each time step, and is the sum of external forces (i.e. gravity) and internal forces (i.e. spring forces, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law">Hook's law</a>).

                    -->
                    Below are the effects of changing the spring constant $k_s$, density, and damping. The default values are denoted with `$\bigstar$'. You can see that the spring constant and density are inversely related to the cloth's 'stiffness' while the dampening factor affects how quickly the cloth moves through air.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Low $k_s$ corresponds to loose connections making a flatter sheet; high $k_s$ means stronger bonds and a more rigid cloth. High density results in more mass, causing more pull from gravity fighting the spring forces; low density has the spring force dominating, producing also a relatively flat cloth. It is when internal and external forces are of similar magnitude the masses are able to be suspended as they fold/drape.

                    Next we implement collisions with spheres and planes allowing for interactions with ours mesh. Above you can see the effect of varying $k_s$ with how it falls upon the sphere: larger values lead to stiffness, resulting in fewer but more pronounced folds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Importantly, to prevent clipping with the plane itself, we add $10^{-4}$ in the direction of the plane's normal vector to the mesh positions.

                <!-- Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state (even if it is still slightly bouncy on the ground). -->
                <!-- Vary the density as well as ks and describe with words and screenshots how they affect the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself. -->
                <p>
                    We now add self-collisions to the cloth so that it may fold on itself. With high density/low $k_s$, the cloth becomes scrunched as it falls -- the relatively weak internal forces are outweighed and you can see a kind of ripple effect as the cloth falls. Conversely, the cloth resists folding over itself, and may even return to a flat sheet with high enough $k_s$ / low density.

                <!-- Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects. -->
                <p>
                    Shaders are small, isolated programs that run in parallel on GPU and play the role of determining the color of each pixel on the screen. <i>Vertex shaders</i> are run on each vertex of the mesh and are responsible for transforming the vertex's position/normal/tangent from model space to screen space. <i>Fragment shaders</i> are run on each fragment (essentially each pixel) and determine the color to be displayed. It does this by operating on the geometric attributes from the vertex shader and interpolating (i.e. using Barycentric coords) to give the appearance of continuous shading.

                    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinn%E2%80%93Phong_reflection_model">Blinn-Phong shading model</a> simulates the way light interacts with a surface by considering three components: ambient, diffuse, and specular. The ambient component is the directionless, passive light in the scene interacting uniformly across all surfaces; the diffuse component is the light that is scattered in all directions from the surface; the specular component is the shiny portion of reflected light. The model is given by:

The dot product comes from Labert's cosine law and $\text{ReLU}$ as we only see light that bounces, not that refracts through the surface. Notice that only the specular component depends on $\mathbf{v}$iewing direction.

                <p>
                    To give the illusion of depth to the mesh based on the texture, we first consider bump mapping: this technique modifies the surface $\mathbf{n}$ormal vector based on the texture's gradient. Displacement mapping, on the other hand, actually perturbs the mesh nodes in the direction of the normal proportional to the texture's value.

                    We can introduce watermelon cat to our cloth by mapping the texture to the vertices of the mesh. And can construct a mirror texture: this works by calculating the reflection of the incoming (viewer-to-surface) vector to then sample from the environment cubemap.
